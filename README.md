### 👋 hi. it's me, gavin!

### about me

I'm a software engineer, in sunny Leith, Scotland. 

I struggle to keep a hobby down, but in the past I've been into: running, cycling, weightlifting, cooking, woodworking, skydiving, rugby, hiking, climbing, coffee, reading, & gaming.

I pick up one or more of those every few months then get bored again, but that's life 🤷‍♀️

I'm currently learning Portuguese 🇧🇷, and spending a lot of time trying to make life nicer for the pigeons that come to eat seeds on my balcony 🐦
